# Coseismic Landslide Probability for an M9 CSZ Earthquake in the Lower Bogachiel River Valley, WA
**By: Brek Chiles, 2022**

## Introduction
The Cascadia Subduction Zone (CSZ) is a significant seismic hazard to the Western Olympic Peninsula in Washington State and can generate M9 megathrust earthquakes that trigger landslides. According to a report by the Cascadia Region Earthquake Workgroup (2013), coastal areas will experience the most ground shaking during a CSZ earthquake. Coastal communities will also lose access to inland areas as ground shaking and landslides cause severe damage to roadways and disrupt transportation networks (Cascadia Region Earthquake Workgroup, 2013). For communities surrounding the Bogachiel River Valley, WA, damaged roadways could prevent people from fleeing tsunami inundation zones and stall relief efforts. 

The Bogachiel River Valley is situated between Clallam and Jefferson counties on the Olympic Peninsula of Washington State (Figure 1). As of 2020, Clallam and Jefferson counties have a combined population of more than a hundred thousand people (Mohrman, 2020). Geographic features including the Olympic Mountain Range, dense forest cover, and coastal plains restrict transportation to narrow routes (Clallam County, 2020). U.S. Highway 101 is a major roadway on the Olympic Peninsula and transects part of the Lower Bogachiel River Valley. The Bogachiel River Valley is subject to seismic activity from the CSZ as the Juan de Fuca plate subducts under the North American plate (Atwater et al., 2015). In a hazard mitigation plan by Clallam County (2010), Clallam County recognizes the vulnerability of U.S. Highway 101 to natural hazards and cites a 2008 landslide that cut off the town of Forks from the highway. 

The purpose of my study is to determine areas where landslides could occur in the Lower Bogachiel River Valley following an M9 CSZ earthquake. Using an empirical model (Nowicki Jessee et al., 2018), I calculate landslide probability given peak ground velocity (PGV) from published M9 CSZ earthquake scenarios (Frankel et al., 2018), and geospatial datasets for deriving topographic slope, compound topographic index (CTI), land cover, and lithology input parameters. With a coseismic landslide probability map, I postulate where we would expect ground failures to occur in the Lower Bogachiel River Valley and estimate the area at high-risk of landslides for an M9 CSZ earthquake. My study of coseismic landslide probability provides insight into potential ground failures from M9 CSZ earthquakes which could help improve hazard and ecosystem mitigation plans for the Lower Bogachiel River Valley.
